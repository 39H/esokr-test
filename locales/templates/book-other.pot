"Processing time is still the greater limiting factor. The injection method "
"requires several days during which the subject is under immense physical "
"pain and mental distress, forcing our workers to expend more effort on "

"Gavros and I have altered the formula to an airborne agent that can be "
"released to process multiple subjects at once, and with much faster "
"turnaround time. This should not only reduce stress on the subjects, but "
"increase the overall product yield assuming enough new subjects are brought "
"in to keep up with the increased demand.\n"
"\n"
"We will begin testing this new method of application as soon as it is ready "
"for deployment. I am positive the results will be astounding."
